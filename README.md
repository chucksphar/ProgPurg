My Programmer Purgatory book chapters and code

I see a handful of books out there for programming newbies, and lots of books for experts. But how does a newbie
become an expert in his own right? There are no books that I can see that fill this gap. Hence my book (still 
unpublished at this date): Escaping Programmer Purgatory: Programming 102.
